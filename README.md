# A-Yen-for-the-future

I make use of time series data and a variety of models to make predictions about FX returns and volatility. I evaluated the quality of these models by analyzing key statistics reported on model results summaries and by employing the metrics library from sklearn. Among the models implemented are ARMA, ARIMA and Linear Regression models, all used to predict the future returns of the CAD/JPY exchange rate. I also implemented GARCH to make a forecast of this variable's volatility.
